using the commmand line django-admin startproject DjangoAPI i created a django project

using the command line djang-admin startapp backend i created a backend app in the django project

in the backend app i created a views.py file which is the file that handels all of the database queries

i also created a urls.py file which handles all of the url pathing for the webserver

In the settings.py file I added a connection in the database section for creating a connection to the MYSQL database

in the DjangoAPI project directory in the urls.py file I added an import to the top called include which will allow me to include urls.py files from other apps

in the urls.py file of the DjangoAPI directory I added a path called path("/database", inlcude("backend.urls"))
this allows for the webserver to use the urls.py file that is associated with the backend app

In the urls.py file in the backend directory I added many different url paths that will be accessed when the url gets a /database/<whatever> request it will use that path the run a function in the views.py file for example. in the urls.py file a path would look like path("list/", views.pullDatabase) this will mean that the pulldatabase function in the views.py file will be used when the web url tries to access it http://localhost/database/list/

With this being said: The API is a basic CRUD api C for create R for replace U for update D for delete

The server is ran by running python3 manage.py runserver in the DjangoAPI directory

and using the postman application you can send http request to the different urls.

for example in postman you can send a get request to 127.0.0.1:8000/database/ava/ which will return the total available spots for each parking space type.
